### Welcome to the Event Handlers in Classes

**Here, all event management for groups, chats, broadcasts, and newsletters is handled by various classes based on their respective event listeners.**

 Each class is created to manage a specific category of events—such as updates to group metadata, modifications to chat states, changes in broadcast lists, or interactions with newsletters—guided by its designated event listener. This class-based structure allows one to easily manage various events with easy.

An example of this approach is the management of connection state changes, which is handled by a dedicated class responsible for managing the connection update event when connecting to WhatsApp server. This class listens for updates indicating whether the connection is active, has been terminated, or requires re-authentication due to session expiration. When the connection status shifts—say, from active to disconnected—the class processes the accompanying details, such as the reason for the disconnection, and triggers appropriate actions like logging the event or initiating a reconnection process.

Other classes in this folder are assigned to handle distinct events: one focuses on processing new or updated messages, another on tracking changes to group details like participant lists or names, and yet another on managing updates to the chat list or broadcast configurations.
