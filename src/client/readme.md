### Welcome to the Connection Modules

**Here's where the connection to the WhatsApp Server is established using Baileys**

This section serves as the entry point for setting up the client, where the connection to WhatsApp's servers is initialized using the Baileys library—a powerful, lightweight tool for interacting with WhatsApp's Web API JavaScript/TypeScript. The setup process here involves critical steps like authentication, establishing a persistent WebSocket connection, and ensuring the client is ready to send and receive data. Baileys simplifies this by managing encryption, session persistence, and low-level protocol details, providing a robust foundation for WhatsApp integration. This is where the core connection logic resides, tying the application to WhatsApp's ecosystem efficiently.

*_All advanced features, such as handling events like message updates, upserts, chats updates, upserts, group updates, upserts, and other event listeners, are managed in separate files within the class folder. Meanwhile, the core connection logic and some important function abstractions, like the `sendMessage` function, are defined here._*

The handling of dynamic events—such as message updates (edits or deletions), upserts (insertions or updates of messages), chat updates, group metadata changes, and other real-time interactions—is delegated to specialized files within a dedicated class folder. This modular approach keeps the codebase organized, allowing event-specific logic to be maintained independently. In contrast, this section focuses on the foundational setup and key abstractions. For example, the `sendMessage` function, which handles 99.9% of the message-sending process (including text, media, and other payloads), is abstracted here for simplicity and reusability. It encapsulates the complexities of message formatting, delivery retries, and error handling, while the core connection logic ensures a stable link to WhatsApp’s servers. This division ensures that critical functionality is accessible and streamlined, while advanced event management remains extensible and scalable in separate modules.
