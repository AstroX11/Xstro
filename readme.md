# `xstro-md` Simple WhatsApp Bot

`xstro-md` is an open-source WhatsApp bot written and enhanced by [AstroX11](https://github.com/AstroX11) to facilitate lazy WhatsApp users like yourself and me. The original purpose of this project was, personally for me, to develop my JavaScript skills. Since you guys like my work, I decided to continue improving and maintaining this project. I hope someone will sponsor me one day, lol.
