## What It Does

`Xstro WA Bot` is a flexible WhatsApp bot that lets you automate messaging, manage group chats, and handle media—all through simple commands or custom triggers. It’s built with TypeScript and uses SQLite3 for lightweight data storage, making it easy to tweak for personal or business use.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AstroX11/Xstro.git
cd Xstro
```

You’ll need Node.js installed. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Custom Authentication**  
 Use the [XstroSession](https://github.com/AstroX11/XstroSession) tool to link your WhatsApp account to the bot

**Run**
`bash
    npm start
    `

Check [the deployment page](https://astrox11.github.io/xstroweb/) for more setup tips.

## Command Creation

You can create custom commands to make the bot do what you want. Here’s how:

### Simple Command

```ts
import { Module } from "#default";

// A basic "hi" command
Module(
    {
        name: "hi", // What users type to trigger it
        fromMe: false, // Anyone can use it, not just the bot owner
        isGroup: false, // Works in private chats and groups
        type: "greetings", // Groups it under "greetings" category
    },
    async (message) => {
        await message.send("Hello"); // Replies with "Hello"
    }
);
```

### Command with Arguments

```ts
import { Module } from "#default";

// A "hi" command that checks for "bot" as an argument
Module(
    {
        name: "hi",
        fromMe: false,
        isGroup: false,
        type: "greetings",
    },
    async (message, args) => {
        // args is what the user types after the command (e.g., ".hi bot")
        if (args.includes("bot")) {
            await message.send(`${message.pushName} Hello Beep Bo Bi`);
        } else {
            await message.send("Try saying '.hi bot'!");
        }
    }
);
```

The `message` object has tons of handy methods—`send`, `react`, `delete`, etc. Dig into the code to see more!

## Custom Events

Want the bot to respond to specific messages without a command? Use event listeners:

```ts
export async function greetingsListener(message) {
    // Listens for messages starting with "Good Morning"
    if (message.text.startsWith("Good Morning")) {
        return message.send(`${message.pushName}, Good Day`);
    }
}
```

Add this to your bot, and it’ll reply automatically whenever someone says "Good Morning"—no prefix needed.
