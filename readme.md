# `xstro-md` Simple WhatsApp Bot

`xstro-md` is an open-source WhatsApp bot written and enhanced by [AstroX11](https://github.com/AstroX11) to facilitate lazy WhatsApp users like yourself and me. The original purpose of this project was, personally for me, to develop my JavaScript skills. Since you guys like my work, I decided to continue improving and maintaining this project. I hope someone will sponsor me one day, lol.

## Setup

_[Fork Repo](https://github.com/AstroX11/Xstro/fork)_

> [!Note]
> Your session ID is created by XstroSession and locked up tight using SessionMaker Crypto. It's saved in an encrypted database on Koyeb, and I can’t access it. Keep your session ID safe and don’t share it with anyone you don’t trust! Only Xstro can unlock it and get the main Baileys session from it. For extra safety, I’ve shared two links to the repositories where these sessions are made. I suggest you create your own for better security. I’m just a student, not a cybersecurity expert, so I can’t promise extra protection!
