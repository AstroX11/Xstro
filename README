Xstro is a simple open source whatsapp third party automation system that uses Baileys Web API to interact seemlessly via web socket.
 For information on Baileys, see :

Baileys is a WebSockets-based TypeScript library for interacting with the WhatsApp Web API.

Installation: 

If you are using windows ensure the following are installed:

Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
Node.js:
powershell -c "irm https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1|iex"
choco install nodejs-lts --version="23"
node -v # Should print "v23.11.0".
npm -v # Should print "10.9.2".

You can use other methods to install Node.js 23x.

Please Note that Xstro supports Node.js 23 and above, this is because it uses the built-in node sqlite module.
I have abstracted it to an ORM, for more Information on the ORM, see:

Session Management:

Xstro uses a custom session and authentication storage via sqlite:

You must create your own session instance and customize it to your needs, session management can be found here:
