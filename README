Installation

Prerequisites (Windows):
Ensure the following tools are installed:

1. Git:
   Download and install Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

2. Node.js:
   Open PowerShell and run the following commands:
   powershell -c "irm https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1|iex"
   choco install nodejs-lts --version="23"
   node -v  # Should print "v23.11.0"
   npm -v   # Should print "10.9.2"

   Alternatively, you can install Node.js version 23x using other methods.

Note: Xstro supports Node.js 23 and above due to the use of the built-in Node SQLite module. This module has been abstracted into an ORM for ease of use. For more information on the ORM, visit:

Session Management

Xstro employs a custom session and authentication storage system via SQLite.
